## Reporting a Vulnerability

We would sincerely try to update as soon as possible, our next update is a menu that would be readable and understandable by beginners.
To report a vulnerability, contact us at vulnerability.report.maximillian@gmail.com, who knows, you might get a shoutout in our 
contributors list, something coming up.
Most probable erros are parameter errors, unneccessary lines of code(we love doing this, kind of our specialty), missing necessary except
blocks and so on.
We will try our best to respond within 48 hours because we got nothing else to do but listen. Thank you for using our code.

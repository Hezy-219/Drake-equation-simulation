## Reporting a Vulnerability

We would sincerely try to update as soon as possible, our next update is a menu that would be readable and understandable by beginners.
To report a vulnerability, contact us at vulnerability.report.maximillian@gmail.com, who knows, you will get a shoutout in our 
contributors list(something coming up).
Most probable erros are parameter errors, unnecessary lines of code(we love doing this, kind of our specialty), missing necessary except
blocks and so on.
Also, send us an email if you want the code without loading aesthetics and you could send designs you think of and we may consider the design/feature and customize your codes.
Be sure to make any and every email clear and detailed. We make programs for everyone, well we simplify it enough for beginners to understand.
We will try our best to respond within 48 hours because we got nothing else to do but listen. Thank you for using our code.
